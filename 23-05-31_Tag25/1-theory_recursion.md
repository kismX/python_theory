## fibonacci
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2), for n > 1

To find the 6th number in sequence, we would start with fib(6).

Since 6 > 1, we would use the recursive forumla to find it:

fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = fib(0) + fib(1) = 1 + 0 = 1
fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
