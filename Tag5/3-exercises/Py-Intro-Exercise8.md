# Exercise 8 - CSV!

Nothing like a chunk of fake data! We are getting semi-realistic over here.

Here, you are given a list of fake user data. Start by copying the following code into your own Python file. After that you will be given tasks to do with the data.

```py
data = """id,first_name,last_name,email,ip_address

## TASKS

### Task 1

- Split the string into a list of strings
    - One line of data is one item in the list
    - Save the list of strings in a variable called `lines`
    - Print the amount of lines

- Loop over the lines using a `for` loop and print every 5th line

### Task 2

- Loop over the lines again
    - Skip the first line (called the header line)
    - Split each line by the commas, saving the result to a variable
    - Using that variable, print only the email addresses of each user

### Task 3

- Find out and print how many users have an email address with `.co.uk` in it
- Find out and print how many users first name OR last name starts with a "K" (uppercase or lowercase)

### Task 4

- For each user, print out a minified list including

    - Their first name
    - The first character of their last name
    - The first two octets of their IP address followed by `.xxx.xxx`

The output would look like this for the first three users:

        Jennine K., 45.55.xxx.xxx
        Katalin N., 223.30.xxx.xxx
        Atalanta K., 254.219.xxx.xxx

### OPTIONAL BONUS TASK

Statistics! Figure print out what are the top 3 most popular email address domains of all users. Print also the amount of users who have those e-mail address domains. The output might look like this (not the real data analyzed here):

        Statistics for top 3 email address domains of our users:
            hotmail.com - 51 users
            gmail.com   - 49 users
            yahoo.com   - 30 users
