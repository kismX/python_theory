# Create a base class called Shape with the following attributes and methods:
# Attributes:
# name (string)
# Methods:
# __init__(self, name): Initializes the name attribute.
# area(self): Computes and returns the area of the shape (0 by default).
# Create two subclasses, Rectangle and Circle, which inherit from the Shape class. 
# Each subclass should override the area method to compute the area specific to the shape.
# Additionally, create a function called total_area that takes a list of shapes and calculates the total area of all the shapes in the list.
# Finally, create instances of the Rectangle and Circle classes, add them to a list, 
# and use the total_area function to calculate and print the total area of all the shapes.
