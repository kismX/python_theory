**Today's Agenda**

- Func as obj.
- closures
- decorators


## Calling Functions
- 1st class objects, which means they can be treated as var
- this allows us to do things like

1. refering to a func by a var name,
2. pass func as input args to other funcs
3. return funcs as output from a func

## Closures
- A closure is a func *f* with an extended scope that includes vars referenced in the body of *f* that are not global or local vars of *f*

- It can access nonglobal variables defined outside functions *f*
