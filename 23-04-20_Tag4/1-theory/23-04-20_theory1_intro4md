# Introduction Day 4

**Yesterday**
- computers and numbers
    - Decimal
    - binary
    - hexadecimal
    - bits and Bytes
        - Bit: 0 1
        - Byte: 8 Bits - 10011010
    - Binary operations: and xor ..

- Conditionals
    - if/elif/else
    - 
- randon Numbers


**Today**
- Fantasy Game character creator
- repeating code with loops
- Functions
-



## LOOPS

- loops repeat codes
- the simplest loop in py i think is "while" loop
- while lop is based on conditional
    - a kind of oike an "if"
    - whe while runs a block of code until the condition is False
    - letz make example (py-datei coding2)
- Note: itÅ› easy to accidentally make an infinite loop
    - dont panic :) -> "ctrl + C" stop it!

- the other kind of loop we will learn today a "for" loop
- in py "for2 loops go over some kind of sequence
    - like characters in a string
    - like items in a list  # most commen case
    - so what is a list?
- lists store multiple items in a singe car
    - items could be strings
    - i. could be numbers
    - lists are "indexed"
    - indexes start from zero
    - indexes are zero-based
- when i say "strings are indexed"

- if you want iterable numbers
    - theres a function for that! --> see .py

- when i say "ranges are indexed"

- you can even have loops inside of loops!


## FUNCTIONS ##
- we used already: print, max, input...
- a functions defines a block of code
    - that you can call when you need it

- functions can take in "arguments"
    - sometimes called "parameters"

- Functions can return a value
