################  Exercise(OOP - Inheritance and Name mangling): ###############

# Create a parent class called Person with the following attributes:
### A private attribute called __name
### A private attribute called __age

# The class should have the following methods:
### A method called set_name that takes a parameter name and sets the value of the private attribute __name to name.
### A method called set_age that takes a parameter age and sets the value of the private attribute __age to age.
### A method called get_name that returns the value of the private attribute __name.
### A method called get_age that returns the value of the private attribute __age.
### Create a child class called Employee that inherits from the Person class. The Employee class should have an additional private attribute called __salary.

# The Employee class should have the following methods:
### A method called set_salary that takes a parameter salary and sets the value of the private attribute __salary to salary.
###- A method called get_salary that returns the value of the private attribute __salary.
### A method called print_name that prints the value of the private attribute __name.

# >>> print.name not available <<<<
#  employee.print_name() # --> John Doe                         ### john doe wird nicht ausgegeben, weil private variable und damit nur in der class oben verf√ºgbar
